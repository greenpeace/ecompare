# Ecompare

**Compare two csv files to check which email addresses are in common and which email addresses are missing in each file.**

## What's the purpose of this script?

* We needed a quick-to-use **database debugging tool** for a vey specific problem: to help in a daily check about the information being sent from the mailing program to the CRM, and in the inverse direction.
* This script creates lists with the common and missing email addresses to be investigated. It can be useful for other purposes as well.
* Besides unique **email addresses** it can compare **sha256 hashes** or **Spanish ID numbers**.
* Parsing and comparing a 41MB file with 400.000 email adresses against another 36MB file with 350.000 email addresses takes 9 seconds in a fast laptop.

## How to use it

#### Get help

**ecompare** is a command line script. To get help type in the command line:

```
./ecompare --help
```

#### Export CSV files

You'll need to export csvs with supporter data in Engaging Networks and create similar exports in Salesforce.

#### Compare CSV files

Download both files as csvs to the same folder as the script. Then, using the command line run the script as:

```
./ecompare -data=emails -A=fileA.csv -B=fileB.csv
```

* `-data` specifies the type of data to compare. It can be `emails`, `sha256` or `dni` (Spanish ID numbers)
* `-A` and `-B` specify the names of both files.

#### Get details about the comparison

When running the script you'll get a quick report like this:

```
WHAT HAPPENED?
File A: fileA.csv
File B: fileB.csv
Parsed emails in fileA.csv : 229
Parsed emails in fileB.csv: 214
In fileB.csv but not in fileA.csv : 0 emails
In fileA.csv but not in fileB.csv : 15 emails
In both fileA.csv and fileB.csv : 214 emails
```

And the script always creates 3 files in the current folder with the results:

1. *in-a-but-not-in-b.txt*
* *in-b-but-not-in-a.txt*
* *in-both-a-and-b.txt*

The filenames describe it's content and running the script again will overwrite this 3 files.

Open this files with your plain/code text editor and investigate the inconsistencies in both your CRM and mailing programs. 

## Install

Currently this script is provided as source code in **[Go](https://golang.org/dl/)**. You can easily download it and compile. Still if some people find it useful I can compile executables and add the links here.
